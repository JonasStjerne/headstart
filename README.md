# CLI tool for scaffolding NestJS & Next.js projects
My attempt at a simple version of the [yo CLI tool](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) for Yeoman generators.

Give your project a head start by using headstart CLI tool to scaffold the project with various technologies. Supports scaffolding Next.js & NestJS projects. The CLI will ask you which technologies your project should include and set up a complete project with these technologies ready to go.

Clone the repo and run `npm i -g` in the root directory. Go to your desired location for a new project and run `npx headstart` to create your project. The CLI will prompt you for a series of questions to generate your project.
